Still a work in progress.

1. Install and activate.
2. Go to CSS Framework in the admin.
3. You can see the CSS variables pulled from assets/css/variables.css. If you edit and save changes, it updates them in the file.
4. If you go to Edit CSS Files you can edit the variables or section classes CSS files directly.

Hope that makes sense.

Currently the section CSS doesn't automatically apply in the editor and I'm working on resolving that.
